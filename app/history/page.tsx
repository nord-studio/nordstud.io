										4 years ago, Nord Studio was publicized

											During the start of a normal day at
											school, all students would head to
											their tutors classroom before the
											first class started. One morning, I
											was super early and class didn&apos;t
											start for another 30 minutes.
											<br /> <br />
											While trying to think of something
											to do, I came up with the idea of
											creating my own brand to represent
											all the projects I&apos;ve been working
											on at home. After googling &quot;words
											that mean going up&quot;, I came across
											one specifc word that peaked my
											interest:
										</p>
										<div className="flex flex-col gap-0 pl-4 py-4">
											<h1 className="text-3xl font-bold font-serif">
												nord [n…îrd]
											</h1>
											<span className="text-lg text-neutral-500 dark:text-neutral-400">
												noun
											</span>
											<p>
												the direction along Earth&apos;s
												surface towards the place where
												the imaginary rotational axis of
												the Earth intersects the surface
												of the Earth.

											I loved it. The word &quot;nord&quot; means
											&quot;true north&quot;, which can be
											symbolised as &quot;going up&quot;. <br />
											<br />
											However, a good name needs a good
											logo. I started off with just the
											letter &quot;N&quot;, and started to play
											around with it. The result of which
											you can see in figure 2.

										Although I just couldn&apos;t get it right,

										notebook trying everything I could to
										make something that fit. A few pages
										ended up in the trash due to my
										frustration.

										But during my math class, I took one of
										my original drawings and tried to expand
										on it. Soon enough, I had something

										I took that same design and tweaked it
										in many different ways to determine if I
										was able to create something better.{" "}
										<br /> <br /> I also numbered them, and
										went around the school asking teachers
										and students which one they like the
										most. Number #4 came first, then #1, #2
										and #3 after. <br /> <br />
