                                        4 years ago, Nord Studio was publicized
                                        with the intent to build new solutions

                                        everyday, such as Campsite, a

                                            During the start of a normal day at
                                            school, all students would head to
                                            their tutors classroom before the
                                            first class started. One morning, I

                                            start for another 30 minutes.

                                            to do, I came up with the idea of
                                            creating my own brand to represent
                                            all the projects I've been working
                                            on at home. After googling "words
                                            that mean going up", I came across
                                            one specifc word that peaked my
                                            interest:

                                            letter "N", and started to play

                                        on it. Soon enough, I had something
